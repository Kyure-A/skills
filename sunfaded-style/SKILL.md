# Sunfaded Style

## Overview

Create UI and graphic layouts with oversized condensed typography, bilingual JP/EN mixing, analog grain, and high-contrast overlays. Favor stark hierarchy and cropped type over delicate ornament.

## Workflow

1. Collect hero text, supporting text, language mix (JP/EN), target format, and asset availability.
2. Establish hierarchy: one dominant word or phrase, two to four secondary labels, and micro credits.
3. Build a strict grid, align edges, and allow type to crop at canvas boundaries.
4. Layer type over image or flat field; add a halftone band or strip for rhythm.
5. Apply texture (film grain, dust, mild blur) while keeping contrast high and the reading path clear.

## Style Pillars

- Typography: Use DIN (condensed/Engschrift if available) uppercase for hero text, pair with bold JP sans. Use micro uppercase for metadata and loosen tracking at small sizes.
- Layout: Scale headlines to edge-crop, repeat words or labels, and mix horizontal and vertical text blocks.
- Texture: Add halftone waves, moire, or noise; keep textures subtle but visible at 100%.
- Color: Prefer monochrome or cool desaturated tones; allow a single vivid accent color.

## UI Adaptation

- Hero: Oversized headline plus a small metadata strip; optional vertical side label.
- Navigation: Tight uppercase labels, separators or rules, and minimal iconography.
- Sections: Image-backed panels with overprint type; use halftone bands as dividers.

## Constraints

- Do not copy or embed copyrighted imagery; use user-provided assets or placeholders.
- Preserve readability; avoid more than two heavy type layers in the same area.
