# Sunfaded Style Reference

## Layout Recipes

### Poster or cover

- Set a 12-column grid and align primary type to column edges.
- Place the hero word at 70 to 90 percent width and crop at one or more edges.
- Add a secondary JP or EN line near the top or midline.
- Add a micro credit block with 6 to 12 lines.
- Add a halftone wave band in the lower third or as a side strip.

### Poster variants

- Photo + oversized hero word + top JP band + micro credits on a white plate.
- White field + halftone wave band + JP/EN blocks + micro credits.
- Oversized arrow crossing the canvas + cropped headline + side credits.

### UI hero or landing

- Use a full-bleed image with a 10 to 20 percent dark overlay for contrast.
- Place a large headline, partially cropped, anchored to a grid edge.
- Place micro metadata along the top or side; use a vertical label for tension.
- Use one thin rule or a band to separate hero from body content.

### Index or list

- Stack repeated title lines and vary scale for rhythm.
- Use thin rules between sections; keep margins generous.
- Pair each item with a small label tile or vertical tag.

## Typography Scale

- Base text: 12 to 16px (web) or 8 to 10pt (print).
- Micro text: 0.6x base with tracking +0.08em.
- Secondary: 1.8x to 3x base with tracking -0.01em.
- Hero: 6x to 12x base with tracking -0.02em to -0.04em.

## Type Mixing

- English: DIN (condensed/Engschrift if available) uppercase.
- JP: bold sans (kaku gothic style).
- Use vertical or rotated labels for side metadata.
- Split EN tokens into short fragments when needed (HATSU / BOSHI / GAKU / EN).

## Typography Detail

- Hero: DIN Condensed/DIN Engschrift, uppercase, heavy weight.
- Secondary: DIN Condensed or DIN Regular.
- Micro: DIN Regular, uppercase, +0.08em to +0.12em tracking, 6 to 12 lines, tight leading.
- JP: bold kaku gothic with neutral tracking.
- Fallback: condensed grotesk if DIN not available.

## Pattern Modules

- Halftone wave band: rectangular strip with diagonal lines warped by a sine curve.
- Label tiles: small rectangles with inverted text.
- Directional arrow: oversized arrow used as a background shape.
- White band: thick strip for headers or micro credits, 10 to 20 percent height.
- Fog band: blurred horizontal strip for soft separation and legibility.
- Scan crease: subtle fold line running horizontally or vertically.
- Scribble lines: loose hand-drawn loops behind type blocks.

## Grid Rules

- 12-column grid, generous gutters.
- Outer margin: 5 to 8 percent.
- Hero text width: 70 to 90 percent of canvas.
- Crop at least one edge to create tension.
- Micro block width: 2 to 4 columns, aligned to a grid edge.
- Band height: 10 to 20 percent for header or divider usage.

## Layout Patterns

- Pattern A: Full-bleed image + oversized hero word + micro credits block + halftone band.
- Pattern B: Repeated hero rows with alternating scale + vertical JP tag.
- Pattern C: Left JP block + right EN headline, both edge-cropped.
- Pattern D: Photo + oversized hero word + top JP band + micro credits on a white plate.
- Pattern E: White field + halftone wave band + JP/EN blocks + micro credits.
- Pattern F: Oversized arrow crossing the canvas + cropped headline + side credits.

## Texture and Finish

- Add film grain at 2 to 6 percent opacity.
- Add mild blur bloom in highlights.
- Add dust or paper texture on light backgrounds.
- Add subtle fold lines to simulate scanned paper.

## Texture Recipes

- Grain: fine noise, uniform across layers.
- Halftone band: diagonal line density at 3 to 6px spacing.
- Bloom: keep text crisp; bloom only highlights.
- Fold line: 1 to 2px line with 2 to 5 percent opacity, slight blur.

## Color Options

- Monochrome: #f2f2f2, #d0d0d0, #111111
- Cool dusk: #d9dde4, #9aa7b7, #1b1f2a
- Electric accent: #0a1cff with #111111 and #f7f7f7
- Paper warm: #f3f0e8, #d7d2c7, #1a1a1a

## UI Tokens (Optional)

- Spacing: large gutters (24 to 48px), tight baseline rhythm.
- Rules: 1 to 2px lines for separators.
- Buttons: rectangular, uppercase, no rounded corners, invert on hover.
- Backplates: white bands or tiles behind micro text for legibility.

## Prompt Scaffold

- "Design a [UI/poster] in sunfaded style. Hero text: [...]. Supporting text: [...]. Lyric line: [...]. Credits: [...]. Use JP/EN mix and EN split tokens. Use [photo/illustration/flat field]. Add halftone band, white band or arrow, light grain, and a single accent color."
